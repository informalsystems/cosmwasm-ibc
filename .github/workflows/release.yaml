# Attempts to perform a release when a particular tag is pushed. This job uses 
# the `cargo release` command and assumes that the `CRATES_TOKEN`secret has 
# been set and contains an API token with which we can publish our crates to 
# crates.io.
#
# The `ibc-derive` publishing process is managed manually since it's not
# consistently published with every release.
#
# If release operation fails partway through due to a temporary error (e.g. the
# crate being published depends on the crate published just prior, but the prior
# crate isn't yet available via crates.io), one can simply rerun this workflow.
